            <i>The <b>édération Internationale de Football Association (lit. 'International Federation of Association Football')</b></i>, <br>more
            commonly known by its acronym <u>FIFA</u> (/ˈfiːfə/ FEE-fə), is the international self-regulatory governing body of association
            <br>football, beach soccer, and futsal. It was founded in 1904 to oversee international competition among the national
            associations of<strong><br> Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain (represented by the Madrid Football Club),</strong>
            <br>Sweden, <del>and Switzerland. Headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, its membership now comprises <mark>211 </mark> associations.</del>
        <br> These national associations must also be members of one of the six regional confederations: CAF (Africa), AFC (Asia and
            Australia), UEFA (Europe), CONCACAF (North & Central America and the Caribbean), OFC (Oceania), and CONMEBOL (South
            America).
            
            <br>FIFA outlines several objectives in its organizational statutes, including growing football internationally, ensuring it
            is accessible to everyone, and advocating for integrity and fair play.[3] It is responsible for organizing and promoting
            football's major international tournaments, notably the World Cup which began in 1930, and the Women's World Cup which
        <br> commenced in 1991. Although FIFA does not solely set the laws of the game, that being the responsibility of the
            International Football Association Board of which FIFA is a member, it applies and enforces the rules across all FIFA
            competitions.[4] All FIFA tournaments generate revenue from sponsorships; in 2022, FIFA had revenues of over US$5.8
            billion, ending the 2019–2022 cycle with a net positive of $1.2 billion, and cash reserves of over $3.9 billion.[5]
            
            <br>Reports by investigative journalists have linked FIFA leadership with corruption, bribery, and vote-rigging related to
            the election of FIFA president Sepp Blatter and the organization's decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to
            Russia and Qatar, respectively. These allegations led to the indictments of nine high-ranking FIFA officials and five
            corporate executives by the US Department of Justice on charges including racketeering, wire fraud, and money
            laundering. On 27 May 2015, several of these officials were arrested by Swiss authorities, who launched a simultaneous
            but separate criminal investigation into how the organization awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Those among these
            officials who were also indicted in the US are expected to be extradited to face charges there as well.[6][7][8]
            
            <br>Many officials were suspended by FIFA's ethics committee including Sepp Blatter[9] and Michel Platini.[10] In early
            2017, reports became public about FIFA president Gianni Infantino attempting to prevent the re-elections[11] of both
            chairmen of the ethics committee, Cornel Borbély and Hans-Joachim Eckert, during the FIFA congress in May 2017.[12][13]
            On 9 May 2017, following Infantino's proposal,[14] FIFA Council decided not to renew the mandates of Borbély and
            Eckert.[14] Together with the chairmen, 11 of 13 committee members were removed. FIFA has been suspected of corruption
            regarding the Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup.[15]
            
            History
            Main article: History of FIFA
            The need for a single body to oversee association football became increasingly apparent at the beginning of the 20th
            century with the increasing popularity of international fixtures. The Fédération Internationale de Football Association
            (FIFA) was founded in the rear of the headquarters of the Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques (USFSA) at
            the Rue Saint Honoré 229 in Paris on 21 May 1904.[16] The French name and acronym are universally adopted outside
            French-speaking countries. The founding members were the national associations of Belgium, Denmark, France, the
            Netherlands, Spain (represented by then-Real Madrid CF; the Royal Spanish Football Federation was not created until
            1913), Sweden and Switzerland.
            
            On the same day, the German Football Association (DFB) declared its intention to affiliate through a telegram.[17]
            
            The first president of FIFA was Robert Guérin. Guérin was replaced in 1906 by Daniel Burley Woolfall from England, by
            then a member of the association. The first tournament FIFA staged, the association football competition for the 1908
            Olympics in London was more successful than its Olympic predecessors, despite the presence of professional footballers,
            contrary to the founding principles of FIFA.[18][19][20][21]
            
            Membership of FIFA expanded beyond Europe with the application of South Africa in 1909, Argentina in 1912, Canada and
            Chile in 1913, and the United States in 1914.[22]
            
            The 1912 Spalding Athletic Library "Official Guide" includes information on the 1912 Olympics (scores and stories),
            AAFA, and FIFA. The 1912 FIFA President was Dan B Woolfall.[23] Daniel Burley Woolfall was president from 1906 to
            1918.[24]
            
            During World War I, with many players sent off to war and the possibility of travel for international fixtures severely
            limited, the organization's survival was in doubt. Post-war, following the death of Woolfall, the organization was run
            by Dutchman Carl Hirschmann. It was saved from extinction but at the cost of the withdrawal of the Home Nations (of the
            United Kingdom), who cited an unwillingness to participate in international competitions with their World War enemies.
            The Home Nations later resumed their membership. The FIFA collection is held by the National Football Museum at Urbis in
            Manchester, England.[25] The first World Cup was held in 1930 in Montevideo, Uruguay.[25]
